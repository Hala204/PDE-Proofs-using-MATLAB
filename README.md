# PDE-Proofs
This repository contains my MATLAB implementations of the gamma and Bessel functions, along with scripts to plot them. These functions are commonly used in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering. also it contains the proof that gamma(0.5) = sqrt(pi) and another proof for the integral of legendere polynomial
